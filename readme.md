    There definitely was a gap of knowledge between javascript and using JQuery, we experienced a lot of trouble "translating" the javascript code with JQuery code. It took a lot longer to understand which functions in JQuery correspond to the same series of function calls and code in javascript. We had particular trouble with using ajax for asynchronization, we were not sure if we had to specify dataType and if we still needed to parse the data after calling ajax function (we did). With just Javascript the development process seemed a bit more straightforward with what we were doing vs having to find JQuery functions that do somewhat the same thing as our code.
